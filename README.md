## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate Software Engineer with a strong academic background (9.44 CGPA in B.Tech Computer Engineering) and a deep interest in building scalable systems.

My journey started with full-stack development (MERN), and over time I expanded into:

* Backend engineering with **Spring Boot & Django**
* Data Engineering concepts
* Dashboard monitoring & data lineage (Palantir ecosystem)
* Writing clean, maintainable, production-ready code

I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing systems, and continuously upgrading my technical depth.
